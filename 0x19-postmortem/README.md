Issue Summary:
--------------

Duration: The outage occurred on January 15, 2024, from 02:30 AM to 04:45 AM (GMT+1).

Impact:

 - The authentication service was down during the outage.
 - Users experienced login failures and were unable to access the platform.
 - Approximately 30% of users were affected.

Timeline:
---------

 - 02:30 AM (GMT+1): Issue detected via automated monitoring alert.
 - 02:35 AM (GMT+1): Initial investigation started; suspected database connectivity issue.
 - 03:00 AM (GMT+1): Misleading path: Focused on the database but found no anomalies.
 - 03:15 AM (GMT+1): Escalated to the Database Operations team.
 - 03:30 AM (GMT+1): Database Operations team identified high CPU load on the authentication service servers.
 - 04:00 AM (GMT+1): Issue escalated to System Performance team for further investigation.
 - 04:15 AM (GMT+1): Root cause identified - DDoS attack causing resource exhaustion.
 - 04:45 AM (GMT+1): Mitigation measures implemented, service restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
--------------------------

 - Root Cause:

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting the authentication service caused a surge in traffic, leading to resource exhaustion and service unavailability.

 - Resolution:

Implemented rate limiting on incoming requests to mitigate the DDoS attack.

Added additional server capacity to handle increased load.

Enhanced DDoS detection and mitigation mechanisms.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
-------------------------------------

 - Improvements/Fixes:

Implement real-time traffic analysis to detect and mitigate potential DDoS attacks.

Enhance monitoring for resource utilization and performance metrics.

Develop and document incident response procedures for DDoS attacks.

 - Tasks:

Update incident response playbook with specific steps for handling DDoS attacks.

Conduct a post-incident review with the Network Security team to identify additional measures.

Implement automated scaling policies to dynamically adjust server capacity during traffic spikes.

Collaborate with third-party DDoS protection services for added defense layers.
